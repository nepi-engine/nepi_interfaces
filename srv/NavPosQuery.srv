# This service allows nodes to request the system's navigation/position state
# and status.

# The query_time represents the point (in the past) for which the nav/pos solution
# is requested. A query_time of 0 signifies that the most current solution is
# requested. The query_time is only valid if it specifies a time within the last
# TBD seconds.
